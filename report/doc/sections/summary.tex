\section{Summary}
We described our deep learning approach to Twitter sentiment analysis on phrase level. We gave a detailed description of our 3-step process consisting of preprocessing, word-vector embeddings production, and classification. In each step, we evaluated several different approaches and combined the best-performing solutions from every step. The resulting model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and provides a novel approach by introducing an attention mechanism to our multi-layer LSTM model.
