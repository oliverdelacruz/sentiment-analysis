* Abstract
  /NOTE: the abstract will be written after we have finished the other sections, as suggested in the
  instructions for writing a scientific paper provided on the lecture website/
* Introduction
  - sentiment analysis is a current research topic
  - although a specific problem, wide range of applications (publishing, economy, artificial
    intelligence, etc.)
  - in this particular case we analyzed twitter posts, classifying them as either positive or
    negative
* Our Method 
** Twitter Dataset
   - the dataset was provided on the course website
   - 2 million posts, with approximately 1 millions posts per class (positive and negative)
   - other datasets are available (e.g. from [[http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/][Sentiment140]]) /NOTE: our dataset is probably a subset of this/
   - emoticons were removed
   - usernames (i.e. @-mentions) were replaced with a token
   - urls were also replaced with a token
   - hashtags were not altered
   - similar to the procedure described in sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the paper [[file:../resources/Sentiment%20Analysis/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf][Twitter Sentiment
     Classification using Distant Supervision]]
** Preprocessing
*** Challenges
    - The language used in tweets differs from standard english. To fit the message into the 140
      character prescribed by the system, an author may use a style similar to telegrams and
      abbreviate words. These abbreviations can be rather unconventional and only have a meaning in
      the context of the message.
    - Because of the informal nature of communication, grammar and orthography are not valued as much
      as with other means of communication.
    - Tweets may contain hashtags which convey a meaning, but are not part of any sentence
      (e.g. #blessed, or #thatsmylife).

    The paper [[file:../resources/Preprocessing/The%20Role%20of%20Pre-Processing%20in%20Twitter%20Sentiment%20Analysis.pdf][The Role of Pre-Processing in Twitter Sentiment Analysis]] tries to address some of these
    challenges.
*** Hashtags
    - /NOTE: Andrea's code treats hashtags as a distinct word of the corpus/
** Word Embedding
** Classification
   - convolutional neural network (CNN)
* Results
** Preprocessing
   /NOTE: show the effect of the preprocessing on the quality of the classifcation/
** Classification
*** Baseline
    /NOTE: what will be use as the baseline to compare our method to?/
* Discussion
  - strenghts and weaknesses
  - implications on the application
* Summary
  /NOTE: show our contribution/
